                      <h2>Patapon</h2>
                      <p>
                        Patapon is a combination of the rhythm and RTS genre, in
                        which you control an army of little eyeballs on their
                        search for 'Earthend'. I'm still playing Patapon 3, but
                        I also have Patapon 2. <br /><br />
                        I have multiple Patapon OC's! Here's a picture of them
                        celebrating Christmas. You can see more of them on

                      <h2>Arknights</h2>
                      <p>
                        Arknights is a mobile tower defense + gacha game. It's
                        set in a post-apocalyptic future setting on the planet
                        Terra. Originium, a valuable material, can infect people
                        with a disease called oripathy, but also allows them to
                        also use Arts magic. The ones suffering from oripathy
                        are often shunned from society because of how infectious
                        the disease is. Your role as the Doctor is to command
                        your Operators to defend themselves from the Reunion
                        movement and the multiple goverments of Terra, while in
                        search for a cure. <br /><br />
                        I have quite a beefy account! You can add me to friends,
                        my username is <b>Hoshi#6474</b>.

                      <h2>Lobotomy Corporation</h2>
                      <p>
                        Lobotomy Corp falls into the management simulator genre.
                        It is inspired by the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the
                        Woods, and Warehouse 13. As the new manager at the
                        company, your task is to watch over beings known as
                        Abnormalities over the course of 50 days.<br /><br />
                        The game is BRUTAL - it took me 200h to beat it, but at
                        least I did it! I do have some OC's based on it, which
                        you can see on
